Introduction
------------
sha is a simple program that hashes files. It uses the National
Institute of Standards and Technology's Secure Hash Algorithm.
It can use SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512, which generate
respectively, hashes of 160, 256, 384, or 512 bits. sha can be
used in scripts to do, for example, file integrity checking.

For more information on SHA (the algorithms), visit:
http://csrc.nist.gov/encryption/tkhash.html

To build sha, see INSTALL.

Using sha is simple. Just pass the names of one or more files on
the command line. By default, sha will use SHA-1 unless passed
one of the following flags: -2 for SHA-256, -3 for SHA-384 or
-5 for SHA-512. Type "sha -h" for help.

If no filenames are given, sha will hash stdin.

If the environment variable SHA_DEFAULT is set, the default hashing
algorithm can be changed. Only the first character of the value of
SHA_DEFAULT is significant. It can be '1' for SHA-1, '2' for SHA-256,
'3' for SHA-384, or '5' for SHA-512. With any other value, sha will
use SHA-1 by default. Again, "sha -h" will display the default.

You may want to perform a sanity check on sha before relying on it.  A
program called "shatest" is built along with sha (but not installed).
If you run shatest, it will display the results of running the various
SHA algorithms on a set of known test vectors. If the resultant hash
matches what is expected, "PASS" will be displayed. Otherwise it will
display "FAIL."

Also, feel free to use my SHA implementations in your own projects.
They are fast and relatively portable. Please see the top of each
source file for copyright and warranty information. See README.SHA
for technical notes.
